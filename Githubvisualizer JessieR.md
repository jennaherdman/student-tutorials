#Introduction#

Github Visualizer is exactly that, a website that allows users to produce a visualization of github repositories. This site shows the scale of repositories and the amount of forks and pulls, and by who, have occurred within those repositories.

#Software & Setup

The visualizer is all in browser, so there is no download, or setup needed. 

#Using the tool

To begin enter in a username from github at the top of the page under "GitHub username". Making sure the "show" button is white, click it to be shown a visualization of the user's repositories. 

The colour of the circles represents the primary language. Blue is Python, red is C, orange is R, green is Java etc

Hovering over the repositories shows the basic information about them, including the amount of forks and last time updated. 

You can select a repository by clicking on the visualization, or scrolling in the top bar. Click "Analyze" to view repository.
This action overlays a graph on the repository visualization, but you can alter that by hovering over the navigation bar. 

In the individual repository view there's a timeline of changes to the files. Green data points indicate additions, while red points show removals. 
The orange dots represent commits. 
The bottom right corner has an index that allows you to see who is adding, deleting or modifying lines and files. 
Clicking "Run" creates a video visualization of that data. 

#Conclusion

Now with a basic understanding of what data is present in the visualizer, you can use it to find mistakes, or just see how data has fared since its creation. 
Having all that information in a concentrated area, and colour coded makes it easier to digest. 
Enjoy!
